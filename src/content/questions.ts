  {
    question: "What if we disagree?",
    answer:
      "Your TIC agreement includes a clear decision-making framework before you buy. Major decisions require consensus; day-to-day choices follow rules you set together. Tomi helps you have these conversations early—when they're hypothetical, not heated.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if someone can't pay?",
    answer:
      "Your agreement defines grace periods, remedies, and buyout terms upfront. We help you plan for life's curveballs—job loss, medical issues, or just changing priorities—so everyone knows what to expect.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we split things fairly?",
    answer:
      "Equity splits can reflect different down payments, ongoing contributions, or sweat equity. Your agreement captures what \"fair\" means to your group specifically—not a one-size-fits-all formula.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if one of us wants to sell?",
    answer:
      "Your agreement includes exit procedures: rights of first refusal for other owners, required notice periods, valuation methods, and buyout terms. No surprises.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this even legal?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Tenancy-in-common has been a recognized ownership structure for centuries. We help you create a legally sound agreement reviewed by attorneys who specialize in co-ownership.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about my credit?",
    answer:
      "Co-buyers typically apply for a mortgage together, so everyone's credit matters. We help you understand requirements early and can connect you with lenders experienced in co-buyer transactions.",
  },
