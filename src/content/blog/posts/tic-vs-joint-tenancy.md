# Tenants in Common vs. Joint Tenancy: The 5-Minute Guide

When you buy a home with someone you're not married to, one of the first legal decisions you'll face is how to hold title. The two most common options are **Tenants in Common (TIC)** and **Joint Tenancy**. Understanding the differences can save you from costly mistakes down the road.

## What is Tenants in Common (TIC)?

Tenants in Common is a form of property ownership where two or more people own a property together, but each person owns a specific percentage share. These shares don't have to be equal.

### Key Features of TIC:

- **Flexible ownership percentages** — One person can own 60%, another 40%, or any split you agree on
- **Separate transferability** — Each owner can sell, gift, or will their share independently
- **No survivorship rights** — When an owner dies, their share goes to their heirs, not the other owners
- **Individual financing** — Each owner can have their own mortgage on their share

## What is Joint Tenancy?

Joint Tenancy is a form of co-ownership where all owners have equal shares and rights to the entire property.

### Key Features of Joint Tenancy:

- **Equal ownership only** — All owners must have exactly equal shares
- **Right of survivorship** — When one owner dies, their share automatically transfers to the surviving owners
- **All-or-nothing transfer** — You can't sell just your share without breaking the joint tenancy
- **Created together** — All owners must acquire their interest at the same time

## TIC vs. Joint Tenancy: Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Tenants in Common | Joint Tenancy |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Ownership shares | Can be unequal | Must be equal |
| Right of survivorship | No | Yes |
| Can sell your share | Yes, independently | Breaks the joint tenancy |
| Estate planning | Share goes to heirs | Share goes to co-owners |
| Best for | Friends, investors, unequal contributions | Married couples, partners who want automatic transfer |

## Which Should You Choose?

### Choose TIC if:

- You and your co-buyers are contributing different amounts
- You want your share to go to your family if something happens to you
- You want the flexibility to sell your share later
- You're buying with friends or as an investment

### Choose Joint Tenancy if:

- You want your share to automatically go to your co-owners
- You're in a committed relationship and want simple estate planning
- Everyone is contributing equally
- You trust that all owners will stay aligned long-term

## The Tomi Recommendation

For most co-buying situations with friends or family, **Tenants in Common is the better choice**. Here's why:

1. **Fairness** — People rarely contribute exactly equal amounts. TIC lets you match ownership to contribution.

2. **Flexibility** — Life changes. TIC makes it easier to handle exits and ownership transfers.

3. **Estate planning** — Most people want their assets to go to their families, not their co-owners.

4. **Legal protection** — With a proper TIC agreement, you can define clear rules for everything from buyouts to disputes.

## Don't Forget the Agreement

Choosing between TIC and Joint Tenancy is just the first step. What really matters is having a comprehensive co-ownership agreement that covers:

- How decisions get made
- What happens if someone wants to sell
- How to handle disputes
- Maintenance and expense responsibilities
- Exit procedures and buyout terms
