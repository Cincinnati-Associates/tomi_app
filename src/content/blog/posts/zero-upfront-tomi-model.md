# How to Buy a Home with $0 Upfront Fees (The Tomi Model)

Traditional real estate is built on a simple premise: you pay whether you succeed or not. Consultations, legal fees, application costs—they all add up before you've even found a home. We think that's backwards.

## The Problem with Traditional Real Estate Fees

When you're buying a home the traditional way, here's what you might pay before you even close:

- **Real estate attorney consultation:** $200-$500
- **Home inspection:** $300-$600
- **Appraisal fees:** $300-$700
- **Application fees:** $50-$100 per lender
- **Credit report fees:** $30-$50
- **TIC agreement drafting:** $1,500-$5,000

And if the deal falls through? You've spent thousands with nothing to show for it. For co-buyers trying to navigate a complex purchase, these costs multiply quickly.

## Why We Do Things Differently

At Tomi, we believe in aligned incentives. If you don't succeed, we don't succeed. Here's our model:

### $0 Upfront

You pay nothing to:
- Use our co-ownership tools and calculators
- Chat with Homi, our AI assistant
- Get matched with co-buyer-friendly lenders
- Draft your co-ownership agreement
- Access our education and resources

### 1% When You Sell

We only get paid when you realize value from your home—typically when you sell. Our fee is 1% of your ownership share's sale price.

**Example:** You own 50% of a home that sells for $600,000. Your share is $300,000. Our fee is $3,000.

## Why This Model Works

1. **No barrier to entry** — Explore co-ownership without financial risk

3. **Long-term partnership** — We stay invested in your success after closing
4. **Flexible timeline** — Take the time you need without watching fees pile up

### For Us:

1. **Better clients** — We attract serious co-buyers, not tire-kickers
2. **Sustainable business** — Our success is tied to yours
3. **Referrals** — Happy homeowners tell their friends

## The Math: Traditional vs. Tomi

Let's compare the costs for a typical co-buying scenario:

### Traditional Route

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Legal consultation | $500 |
| TIC agreement (attorney) | $3,000 |
| Deal falls through (inspection, appraisal) | $800 |
| Second attempt (more fees) | $500 |
| **Total before closing** | **$4,800** |

### The Tomi Way

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Everything before closing | $0 |
| **Total before closing** | **$0** |

At closing, you've saved $4,800. When you sell (let's say 7 years later), you pay 1% of your share—likely less than what you saved in upfront costs, and you've had use of that money the entire time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I never sell?

If you own the home forever and never sell your share, you never pay us. Our fee only applies when value is realized through a sale or buyout.

### What if I buy out my co-owner?

If you buy out a co-owner's share, that's a sale from their perspective—they would pay 1% of their sale price, not you.

### What if the market drops and I sell at a loss?

You pay 1% of what you actually receive. If you sell your $200,000 share for $150,000, you pay $1,500, not $2,000.

### How does Tomi make money if deals fall through?

We don't—on that specific deal. But our model means we're highly motivated to help you succeed. We invest in tools, technology, and people that increase successful outcomes.

### Is this too good to be true?

We understand the skepticism. Here's the reality: traditional real estate charges upfront because that's how it's always been done. Technology and scale allow us to serve more people more efficiently. We bet on the math of success rates rather than charging everyone whether they succeed or not.

## Why Aligned Incentives Matter in Co-Buying

Co-buying is already complex. You're coordinating multiple people, lenders, and legal structures. The last thing you need is a service provider who gets paid whether you find the right home or not.

With Tomi:
- We won't rush you into a bad deal to collect fees
- We won't disappear after closing because we're invested in your long-term success
- We're motivated to help you find co-buyers and homes that actually work
