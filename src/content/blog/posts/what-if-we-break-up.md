# The "What If We Break Up" Clause: How to Write a TIC Agreement

Nobody wants to think about their co-ownership ending badly. But the best time to plan for conflict is when everyone is still getting along. A well-written TIC (Tenants in Common) agreement is your insurance policy against future disagreements.

## Why You Need an Agreement Before You Buy

Think of a TIC agreement like a prenup for your house. It's not pessimistic—it's practical. Here's what can go wrong without one:

- **Someone wants out** — Without exit terms, you could end up in court
- **Someone stops paying** — Who covers their share? For how long?
- **Someone dies** — Their heirs might not want to co-own with you
- **Someone gets divorced** — Their ex could end up as your co-owner
- **Major disagreement** — No clear way to resolve disputes

## The Essential Clauses Every TIC Agreement Needs

### 1. Ownership Percentages and Contributions

Be crystal clear about:
- Who owns what percentage
- What each person contributed (down payment, closing costs)
- How ongoing payments are split (mortgage, taxes, insurance)

> "We recommend that ownership percentages reflect actual financial contributions. If one person puts in 60% of the down payment, they should own 60%."

### 2. The Exit Strategy (The "What If We Break Up" Clause)

This is the most important section. Cover these scenarios:

**Voluntary Exit:**
- How much notice must the departing owner give? (Usually 60-90 days)
- Do remaining owners get first right of refusal?
- How is the buyout price determined? (Appraisal, agreed formula, etc.)
- What's the timeline for completing a buyout?

**Forced Sale:**
- What triggers a forced sale? (e.g., no buyer found within 6 months)
- How are sale proceeds divided?
- Who manages the sale process?

### 3. Right of First Refusal (ROFR)

This clause gives existing owners the first opportunity to buy a departing owner's share before it's offered to outsiders. Key terms to include:

- Notice period for the selling owner
- Time frame for remaining owners to decide
- Matching rights (can remaining owners match any outside offer?)
- What happens if remaining owners can't afford to buy?

### 4. Buyout Valuation Method

How will you determine fair market value? Options include:

- **Professional appraisal** — Most objective, costs $300-$500
- **Average of multiple appraisals** — More accurate, more expensive
- **Agreed formula** — e.g., purchase price + improvements + appreciation percentage
- **Mutual agreement** — Only works if everyone stays friendly

### 5. Default and Remedies

What happens when someone doesn't pay their share?

- **Grace period** — Usually 15-30 days before it's considered default
- **Cure period** — Additional time to fix the default
- **Penalties** — Late fees, interest charges
- **Ultimate remedy** — Forced buyout at discounted price, or forced sale

### 6. Decision-Making Framework

Not everything needs unanimous consent. Define which decisions require:

**Unanimous consent:**
- Selling the property
- Taking out additional debt
- Major structural changes

**Majority vote:**
- Selecting contractors
- Non-structural renovations
- Changing insurance providers

**Individual discretion:**
- Decorating personal spaces
- Minor repairs under $X amount

### 7. Dispute Resolution

Courts are expensive and slow. Include alternatives:

- **Mediation first** — A neutral third party helps you reach agreement
- **Binding arbitration** — If mediation fails, an arbitrator decides
- **Attorney fees** — Who pays if it goes to court? (Loser pays is common)

### 8. Death and Incapacity

Plan for the unexpected:

- What happens to someone's share if they die?
- Do remaining owners have the right to buy from heirs?
- At what price and timeline?
- What if an owner becomes incapacitated?

## Sample Exit Clause Language

Here's an example of how a well-written exit clause might read:

> **Voluntary Withdrawal.** Any Owner may elect to sell their Ownership Interest by providing written notice to all other Owners ("Exit Notice"). Within thirty (30) days of the Exit Notice, remaining Owners shall have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase the departing Owner's interest at fair market value as determined by a licensed appraiser mutually agreed upon by the parties. If remaining Owners do not exercise this right, the departing Owner may sell to a third party, subject to the remaining Owners' right of first refusal.

## How Much Does a TIC Agreement Cost?

Professional TIC agreements typically cost:

- **DIY templates:** $50-$200 (risky—may not be enforceable)
- **Online legal services:** $200-$500 (better, but generic)
- **Real estate attorney:** $1,500-$5,000 (recommended for complex situations)
- **Through Tomi:** Included in our service (customized + attorney-reviewed)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being too vague** — "We'll figure it out later" is not a plan
2. **Forgetting about appreciation** — Your $500K house might be worth $700K when someone exits
3. **Ignoring state laws** — TIC rules vary by state
4. **Not updating the agreement** — Life changes; your agreement should too
5. **Skipping the hard conversations** — If you can't discuss worst-case scenarios now, how will you handle them later?

## The Bottom Line

A TIC agreement isn't about expecting the worst—it's about protecting everyone's investment and relationships. The best agreements are the ones that never need to be used because everyone understood the rules from day one.
